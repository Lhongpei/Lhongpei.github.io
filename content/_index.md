          About Me
        </h3>


        I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (2021.9 - 2025.6), specializing in the Interdisciplinary Science Experimental Class.

        My coursework includes Optimization, Operations Management, Algorithm Design, and Machine Learning.

        ### ðŸ“š My Research

        My research interests include **Optimization**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and the **interdisciplinary area between Operations Research and Machine Learning**.

        Currently, I am particularly focused on:

        * Developing optimization-based framework to enhance the training and inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs)
        * Accelerating classical optimization methods by leveraging AI techniques that learn from historical data
        * Designing and implementing efficient optimization algorithms for large-scale problems, with a particular focus on GPU-accelerated methods
