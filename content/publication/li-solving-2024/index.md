abstract: The Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling (IPPS) problem combines process
  route planning and shop scheduling to achieve high efficiency in manufacturing and
  maximize resource utilization, which is crucial for modern manufacturing systems.
  Traditional methods using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and heuristic
  algorithms can not well balance solution quality and speed when solving IPPS. In
  this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method.
  We model the IPPS problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Heterogeneous
  Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture the complex relationships among operations,
  machines, and jobs. To optimize the scheduling strategy, we use Proximal Policy
  Optimization (PPO). Experimental results show that, compared to traditional methods,
  our approach significantly improves solution efficiency and quality in large-scale
  IPPS instances, providing superior scheduling strategies for modern intelligent
  manufacturing systems.
