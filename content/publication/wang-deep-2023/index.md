abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has opened up many unprecedented opportu­
  nities in revolutionizing the digital marketing field. In this study, we designed
  a DRL-based personalized targeting strategy in a sequential setting. We show that
  the strategy is able to address three important challenges of sequential targeting:
  (1) forward looking (balancing between a firm’s current revenue and future revenues),
  (2) earning while learning (maximizing profits while continuously learning through
  exploration-exploitation), and (3) scalability (cop­ ing with a high-dimensional
  state and policy space). We illustrate this through a novel design of a DRL-based
  artificial intelligence (AI) agent. To better adapt DRL to complex consumer behavior
  dimensions, we proposed a quantization-based uncertainty learning heuristic for
  effi­ cient exploration-exploitation. Our policy evaluation results through simulation
  suggest that the proposed DRL agent generates 26.75% more long-term revenues than
  can the non-DRL approaches on average and learns 76.92% faster than the second fastest
  model among all bench­ marks. Further, in order to better understand the potential
  underlying mechanisms, we con­ ducted multiple interpretability analyses to explain
  the patterns of learned optimal policy at both the individual and population levels.
  Our findings provide important managerialrelevant and theory-consistent insights.
  For instance, consecutive price promotions at the begin­ ning can capture price-sensitive
  consumers’ immediate attention, whereas carefully spaced nonpromotional “cooldown”
  periods between price promotions can allow consumers to adjust their reference points.
  Additionally, consideration of future revenues is necessary from a longterm horizon,
  but weighing the future too much can also dampen revenues. In addition, analy­ ses
  of heterogeneous treatment effects suggest that the optimal promotion sequence pattern
  highly varies across the consumer engagement stages. Overall, our study results
  demonstrate DRL’s potential to optimize these strategies’ combination to maximize
  long-term revenues.'
