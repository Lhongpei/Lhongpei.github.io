 abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has opened up many unprecedented opportu­ nities in revolutionizing the digital marketing field. In this study, we designed a DRL-based personalized targeting strategy in a sequential setting. We show that the strategy is able to address three important challenges of sequential targeting: (1) forward looking (balancing between a firm’s current revenue and future revenues), (2) earning while learning (maximizing profits while continuously learning through exploration-exploitation), and (3) scalability (cop­ ing with a high-dimensional state and policy space). We illustrate this through a novel design of a DRL-based artificial intelligence (AI) agent. To better adapt DRL to complex consumer behavior dimensions, we proposed a quantization-based uncertainty learning heuristic for effi­ cient exploration-exploitation. Our policy evaluation results through simulation suggest that the proposed DRL agent generates 26.75% more long-term revenues than can the non-DRL approaches on average and learns 76.92% faster than the second fastest model among all bench­ marks. Further, in order to better understand the potential underlying mechanisms, we con­ ducted multiple interpretability analyses to explain the patterns of learned optimal policy at both the individual and population levels. Our findings provide important managerialrelevant and theory-consistent insights. For instance, consecutive price promotions at the begin­ ning can capture price-sensitive consumers’ immediate attention, whereas carefully spaced nonpromotional “cooldown” periods between price promotions can allow consumers to adjust their reference points. Additionally, consideration of future revenues is necessary from a longterm horizon, but weighing the future too much can also dampen revenues. In addition, analy­ ses of heterogeneous treatment effects suggest that the optimal promotion sequence pattern highly varies across the consumer engagement stages. Overall, our study results demonstrate DRL’s potential to optimize these strategies’ combination to maximize long-term revenues.},
