abstract: 'This work focuses on a new flexible scheduling problem in the job-shop
  that considers both maintenance activity and repairman competence under maintenance
  time window and employee timetable constraints. To deal with this problem, a hybrid
  multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (HMOBBO) algorithm is proposed,
  which has the following features: (1) a flexible decoding mechanism that considers
  maintenance time window and heterogeneous repairman constraints is designed; (2)
  three calculation methods of habitat suitability index (HSI) are defined; (3) tabu
  search (TS) algorithm is incorporated into the presented algorithm; and (4) a new
  offspring population generation mechanism is constructed. In numerical simulation,
  the parameter setting is firstly analyzed to ensure its robustness for different
  datasets via comparing the performance of each critical parameter combination. Secondly,
  different HSIs and migration models are separately compared through multiply running
  the literature instances, it is shown that fitness function 2 (the reciprocal of
  the sum of the normalized objective function values) and migration model 1 (constant
  immigration and linear emigration model) are the most suitable and steady in our
  experiments. Thirdly, the superiority of HMOBBO is proved by confronting with other
  six intelligent algorithms. Finally, through contrast variant models, the significance
  of considering employee timetable and repairman assignment is verified, and the
  benefits of the integrated optimization model/method are also demonstrated by comparing
  with hierarchical optimization model/method.'
