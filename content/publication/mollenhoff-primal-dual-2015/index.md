abstract: This paper deals with the analysis of a recent reformulation of the primal-dual
  hybrid gradient method, which allows one to apply it to nonconvex regularizers.
  Particularly, it investigates variational problems for which the energy to be minimized
  can be written as G(u) + F (Ku), where G is convex, F is semiconvex, and K is a
  linear operator. We study the method and prove convergence in the case where the
  nonconvexity of F is compensated for by the strong convexity of G. The convergence
  proof yields an interesting requirement for the choice of algorithm parameters,
  which we show to be not only suﬃcient, but also necessary. Additionally, we show
  boundedness of the iterates under much weaker conditions. Finally, in several numerical
  experiments we demonstrate eﬀectiveness and convergence of the algorithm beyond
  the theoretical guarantees.
