abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging
  due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that
  they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting
  in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge,
  diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solverâ€™s search scope, we focus
  on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion.
  By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion
  facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more
  efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving
  general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates
  superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered
  combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics
  for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant
  potential in advancing combinatorial optimization. The codebase of our study is
  available in https://github.com/AwakerMhy/HeO.
