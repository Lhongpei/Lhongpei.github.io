abstract: Graph transformers are a recent advancement in machine learning, offering
  a new class of neural network models for graph-structured data. The synergy between
  transformers and graph learning demonstrates strong performance and versatility
  across various graph-related tasks. This survey provides an in-depth review of recent
  progress and challenges in graph transformer research. We begin with foundational
  concepts of graphs and transformers. We then explore design perspectives of graph
  transformers, focusing on how they integrate graph inductive biases and graph attention
  mechanisms into the transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy
  classifying graph transformers based on depth, scalability, and pre-training strategies,
  summarizing key principles for effective development of graph transformer models.
  Beyond technical analysis, we discuss the applications of graph transformer models
  for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks, exploring their potential in
  other application scenarios as well. Finally, we identify remaining challenges in
  the field, such as scalability and efficiency, generalization and robustness, interpretability
  and explainability, dynamic and complex graphs, as well as data quality and diversity,
  charting future directions for graph transformer research.
