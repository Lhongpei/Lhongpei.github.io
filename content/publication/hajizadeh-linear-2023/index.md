abstract: Recently, minimax optimization received renewed focus due to modern applications
  in machine learning, robust optimization, and reinforcement learning. The scale
  of these applications naturally leads to the use of Ô¨Årst-order methods. However,
  the nonconvexities and nonconcavities present in these problems, prevents the application
  of typical Gradient Descent-Ascent, which is known to diverge even in bilinear problems.
  Recently, it was shown that the Proximal Point Method (PPM) converges linearly for
  a family of nonconvex-nonconcave problems. In this paper, we study the convergence
  of a damped version of Extra-Gradient Method (EGM) which avoids potentially costly
  proximal computations, only relying on gradient evaluation. We show that EGM converges
  linearly for smooth minimax optimization problem satisfying the same nonconvex-nonconcave
  condition needed by PPM.
