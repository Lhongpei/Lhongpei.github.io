abstract: We describe results from Dasaratha and He [DH21a] and Dasaratha and He [DH20]
  about how network structure influences social learning outcomes. These papers share
  a tractable sequential model that lets us compare learning dynamics across networks.
  With Bayesian agents, incomplete networks can generate informational confounding
  that makes learning arbitrarily inefficient. With naive agents, related forces can
  lead to mislearning.
