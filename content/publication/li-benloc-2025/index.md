abstract: The automatic configuration of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) optimizers
  has become increasingly critical as the large number of configurations can significantly
  affect solver performance. Yet the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks has
  led to data leakage and over-optimistic claims, as prior studies often rely on homogeneous
  datasets and inconsistent experimental setups. To promote a fair evaluation process,
  we present BenLOC, a comprehensive benchmark and open-source toolkit, which not
  only offers an end-to-end pipeline for learning instance-wise MIP optimizer configurations,
  but also standardizes dataset selection, train-test splits, feature engineering
  and baseline choice for unbiased and comprehensive evaluations. Leveraging this
  framework, we conduct an empirical analysis on five well-established MIP datasets
  and compare classical machine learning models with handcrafted features against
  state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques. The results demonstrate the importance
  of datasets, features and baseline criteria proposed by BenLOC and the effectiveness
  of BenLOC in providing unbiased and comprehensive evaluations.
