 abstract = {The High Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG) benchmark has been recently proposed as a complement to the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark currently used to rank supercomputers in the Top500 list. This new benchmark solves a large sparse linear system using a multigrid preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm. The PCG algorithm contains the computational and communication patterns prevalent in the numerical solution of partial diﬀerential equations and is designed to better represent modern application workloads which rely more heavily on memory system and network performance than HPL. GPU accelerated supercomputers have proved to be very eﬀective, especially with regard to power eﬃciency, for accelerating compute intensive applications like HPL. This paper will present the details of a CUDA implementation of HPCG, and the results obtained at full scale on the largest GPU supercomputers available: the Cray XK7 at ORNL and the Cray XC30 at CSCS. The results indicate that GPU accelerated supercomputers are also very eﬀective for this type of workload.},
