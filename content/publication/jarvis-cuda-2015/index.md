abstract: 'The High Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG) benchmark has been recently
  proposed as a complement to the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark currently
  used to rank supercomputers in the Top500 list. This new benchmark solves a large
  sparse linear system using a multigrid preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm.
  The PCG algorithm contains the computational and communication patterns prevalent
  in the numerical solution of partial diﬀerential equations and is designed to better
  represent modern application workloads which rely more heavily on memory system
  and network performance than HPL. GPU accelerated supercomputers have proved to
  be very eﬀective, especially with regard to power eﬃciency, for accelerating compute
  intensive applications like HPL. This paper will present the details of a CUDA implementation
  of HPCG, and the results obtained at full scale on the largest GPU supercomputers
  available: the Cray XK7 at ORNL and the Cray XC30 at CSCS. The results indicate
  that GPU accelerated supercomputers are also very eﬀective for this type of workload.'
