 abstract = {In this paper, we propose an original double ﬂexible job-shop scheduling problem (DFJSP), in which both workers and machines are ﬂexible. Because of the characteristics of double ﬂexibility, DFJSP conforms to practical production better than the ﬂexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In addition, a multiobjective optimization mathematic model according to the DFJSP is proposed, which is concerned with the processing time indicator that is usually optimized by most existing studies; green production indicators, namely, factors regarding environmental protection; and human factor indicators, which are actual indispensable elements that exist in the production system. Furthermore, ten benchmarks of DFJSP are presented and solved using a newly proposed hybrid genetic algorithm (NHGA). With the proposed NHGA, a new well-designed three-layer chromosome encoding method and some effective crossover and mutation operators are developed. To obtain the best combination of key parameters in NHGA, the Taguchi design of experiment method is used for their evaluation. Finally, comparisons between NHGA and NSGA-II show that the proposed NHGA has advantages in terms of the solving accuracy and efﬁciency of the DFJSP, particularly at a large scale. It would be beneﬁcial to apply our proposed model to the multi-objective optimization of scheduling problems, especially those considering human factor and green production-related indicators.},
