abstract: Large-scale competitive market equilibrium problems arise in a wide range
  of important applications, including economic decision-making and intelligent manufacturing.
  Traditional solution methods, such as interior-point algorithms and certain projection-based
  approaches, often fail to scale effectively to large problem instances. In this
  paper, we propose an efficient computational framework that integrates the primal-dual
  hybrid conjugate gradient (PDHCG) algorithm with GPU-based parallel computing to
  solve large-scale Fisher market equilibrium problems. By exploiting the underlying
  mathematical structure of the problem, we establish a theoretical guarantee of linear
  convergence for the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed framework can
  be extended to solve large-scale Arrow-Debreu market equilibrium problems through
  a fixed-point iteration scheme. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on GPU
  platforms demonstrate substantial improvements in computational efficiency, significantly
  expanding the practical solvable scale and applicability of market equilibrium models.
