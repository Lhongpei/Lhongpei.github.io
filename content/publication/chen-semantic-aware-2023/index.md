abstract: For cyber-physical systems in the 6G era, semantic communications connecting
  distributed devices for dynamic control and remote state estimation are required
  to guarantee application-level performance, not merely focus on communication-centric
  performance. Semantics here is a measure of the usefulness of information transmissions.
  Semantic-aware transmission scheduling of a large system often involves a large
  decision-making space, and the optimal policy cannot be obtained by existing algorithms
  effectively. In this paper, we first investigate the fundamental properties of the
  optimal semantic-aware scheduling policy and then develop advanced deep reinforcement
  learning (DRL) algorithms by leveraging the theoretical guidelines. Our numerical
  results show that the proposed algorithms can substantially reduce training time
  and enhance training performance compared to benchmark algorithms.
