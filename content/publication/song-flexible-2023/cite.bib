 abstract = {Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to learn priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving complex scheduling problems. However, existing works face challenges in dealing with ﬂexibility, which allows an operation to be scheduled on one out of multiple machines and is often required in practice. Such one-to-many relationship brings additional complexity in both decision-making and state representation. This paper considers the well-known Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), and addresses these issues by proposing a novel DRL method to learn high-quality PDRs end-to-end. The operation selection and machine assignment are combined as a composite decision. Moreover, based on a novel heterogeneous graph representation of scheduling states, a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network based architecture is proposed to capture complex relationships among operations and machines. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional PDRs and is computationally efﬁcient, even on instances of larger scales and different properties unseen in training.},
