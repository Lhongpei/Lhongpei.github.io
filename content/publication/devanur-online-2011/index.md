abstract: The design and analysis of online algorithms, where the input to the algorithm
  is revealed over time and the algorithm has to make decisions immediately without
  knowing the future input, has received a revived interest in the last few years
  primarily due to their application to online advertising. The canonical problem
  is the Adwords problem, which is motivated by the problem of optimally allocating
  ad slots on search queries to budget constrained advertisers. It involves simplifications
  that ignore certain aspects of the actual way this allocation is done. For instance,
  it assumes a \"first-price\" pay-per-impression scheme, ignoring the game theoretic
  aspects, and considers only one slot per query. To be precise, the Adwords problem
  is as follows.
