abstract: This article studies the scheduling problem for a remanufacturing system
  with parallel disassembly workstations, parallel flow-shop-type reprocessing lines
  and parallel reassembly workstations. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective
  optimization problem which contains both energy consumption and makespan to be addressed
  using an improved multi-objective invasive weed optimization (MOIWO) algorithm.
  Two vectors regarding workstation assignment and operation scheduling jointly form
  a solution. A hybrid initialization strategy is utilized to improve the solution
  quality and the Sigma method is adopted to rate each solution. A novel seed spatial
  dispersal mechanism is introduced and four designed mutation operations cooperate
  to enhance search ability. A group of numerical experiments and a practical case
  involving the disassembly of transmission devices are carried out and the results
  validate the effectiveness of the MOIWO algorithm for the considered problem compared
  with existing methods.
