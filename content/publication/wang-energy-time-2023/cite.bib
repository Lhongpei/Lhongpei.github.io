 abstract = {This article studies the scheduling problem for a remanufacturing system with parallel disassembly workstations, parallel flow-shop-type reprocessing lines and parallel reassembly workstations. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem which contains both energy consumption and makespan to be addressed using an improved multi-objective invasive weed optimization (MOIWO) algorithm. Two vectors regarding workstation assignment and operation scheduling jointly form a solution. A hybrid initialization strategy is utilized to improve the solution quality and the Sigma method is adopted to rate each solution. A novel seed spatial dispersal mechanism is introduced and four designed mutation operations cooperate to enhance search ability. A group of numerical experiments and a practical case involving the disassembly of transmission devices are carried out and the results validate the effectiveness of the MOIWO algorithm for the considered problem compared with existing methods.},
