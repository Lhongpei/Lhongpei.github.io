abstract: Minimax optimization has become a central tool in machine learning with
  applications in robust optimization, reinforcement learning, GANs, etc. These applications
  are often nonconvexnonconcave, but the existing theory is unable to identify and
  deal with the fundamental diﬃculties this poses. In this paper, we study the classic
  proximal point method (PPM) applied to nonconvexnonconcave minimax problems. We
  ﬁnd that a classic generalization of the Moreau envelope by Attouch and Wets provides
  key insights. Critcally, we show this envelope not only smooths the objective but
  can convexify and concavify it based on the level of interaction present between
  the minimizing and maximizing variables. From this, we identify three distinct regions
  of nonconvex-nonconcave problems. When interaction is suﬃciently strong, we derive
  global linear convergence guarantees. Conversely when the interaction is fairly
  weak, we derive local linear convergence guarantees with a proper initialization.
  Between these two settings, we show that PPM may diverge or converge to a limit
  cycle.
