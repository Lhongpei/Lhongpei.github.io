abstract: Many manufacturing systems need more than one type of resource to co-work
  with. Commonly studied flexible job shop scheduling problems merely consider the
  main resource such as machines and ignore the impact of other types of resource.
  As a result, scheduling solutions may not put into practice. This paper therefore
  studies the dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem when
  loading and unloading time (DRFJSP-LU) of the fixtures is considered. It formulates
  a multi-objective mathematical model to jointly minimize the makespan and the total
  setup time. Considering the influence of resource requirement similarity among different
  operations, we propose a similarity-based scheduling algorithm for setup-time reduction
  (SSA4STR) and then an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II)
  to optimize the DRFJSP-LU. Experimental results show that the SSA4STR can effectively
  reduce the loading and unloading time of fixtures while ensuring a level of makespan.
  The experiments also verify that the scheduling solution with multiple resources
  has a greater guiding effect on production than the scheduling result with a single
  resource.
