abstract: Although duality is used extensively in certain ﬁelds, such as supervised
  learning in machine learning, it has been much less explored in others, such as
  reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we show how duality is involved in a
  variety of RL work, from that which spearheaded the ﬁeld, such as Richard Bellman’s
  value iteration, to that which was done within just the past few years yet has already
  had signiﬁcant impact, such as TRPO, A3C, and GAIL. We show that duality is not
  uncommon in reinforcement learning, especially when value iteration, or dynamic
  programming, is used or when ﬁrst or second order approximations are made to transform
  initially intractable problems into tractable convex programs.
