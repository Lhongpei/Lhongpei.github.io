abstract: Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to learn priority
  dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving complex scheduling problems. However, existing
  works face challenges in dealing with ﬂexibility, which allows an operation to be
  scheduled on one out of multiple machines and is often required in practice. Such
  one-to-many relationship brings additional complexity in both decision-making and
  state representation. This paper considers the well-known Flexible Job-shop Scheduling
  Problem (FJSP), and addresses these issues by proposing a novel DRL method to learn
  high-quality PDRs end-to-end. The operation selection and machine assignment are
  combined as a composite decision. Moreover, based on a novel heterogeneous graph
  representation of scheduling states, a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network based
  architecture is proposed to capture complex relationships among operations and machines.
  Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional PDRs and is computationally
  efﬁcient, even on instances of larger scales and different properties unseen in
  training.
