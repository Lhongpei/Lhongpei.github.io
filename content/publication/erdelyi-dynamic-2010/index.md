abstract: In this paper, we develop a revenue management model to jointly make the
  capacity allocation and overbooking decisions over an airline network. Our approach
  begins with the dynamic programming formulation of the capacity allocation and overbooking
  problem and uses an approximation strategy to decompose the dynamic programming
  formulation by the flight legs. This decomposition idea opens up the possibility
  of obtaining approximate solutions by concentrating on one flight leg at a time,
  but the capacity allocation and overbooking problem that takes place over a single
  flight leg still turns out to be intractable. We use a state aggregation approach
  to obtain high-quality solutions to the single-leg problem. Overall, our model constructs
  separable approximations to the value functions, which can be used to make the capacity
  allocation and overbooking decisions for the whole airline network. Computational
  experiments indicate that our model performs significantly better than a variety
  of benchmark strategies from the literature.
