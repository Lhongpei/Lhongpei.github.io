abstract: The primal-dual hybrid gradient method, modiﬁed (PDHGM, also known as the
  Chambolle–Pock method), has proved very successful for convex optimization problems
  involving linear operators arising in image processing and inverse problems. In
  this paper, we analyze an extension to nonconvex problems that arise if the operator
  is nonlinear. Based on the idea of testing, we derive new step-length parameter
  conditions for the convergence in inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and provide
  acceleration rules for suitably (locally and/or partially) monotone problems. Importantly,
  we prove linear convergence rates as well as global convergence in certain cases.
  We demonstrate the eﬃcacy of these step-length rules for PDE-constrained optimization
  problems.
