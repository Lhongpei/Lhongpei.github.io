 abstract = {Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is among the combinatorial optimization and Non-Deterministic Polynomial-time (NP) problems. Researchers have contributed in this area using several methods, among the methods we have machine learning algorithms, more precisely Reinforcement Learning (RL). The reason why the scientists resort to RL is the adequacy of the algorithm for this type of problem. The results of the RL approach tend toward optimal or nearoptimal solutions. In this paper, we deal with the JSSP, using the RL algorithm, more specifically a Q-learning algorithm. We propose a new representation of the state of the environment. We introduce two evaluations of the agent using two different methods. The actions selected by the agent are the dispatching rules. Finally, we compared the results obtained by the approach with the literature.},
