abstract: Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is among the combinatorial optimization
  and Non-Deterministic Polynomial-time (NP) problems. Researchers have contributed
  in this area using several methods, among the methods we have machine learning algorithms,
  more precisely Reinforcement Learning (RL). The reason why the scientists resort
  to RL is the adequacy of the algorithm for this type of problem. The results of
  the RL approach tend toward optimal or nearoptimal solutions. In this paper, we
  deal with the JSSP, using the RL algorithm, more specifically a Q-learning algorithm.
  We propose a new representation of the state of the environment. We introduce two
  evaluations of the agent using two different methods. The actions selected by the
  agent are the dispatching rules. Finally, we compared the results obtained by the
  approach with the literature.
