abstract: Recent advancements in the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSSP)
  are primarily based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) due to its ability to generate
  high-quality, real-time solutions. However, DRL approaches often fail to fully harness
  the strengths of existing techniques such as exact methods or constraint programming
  (CP), which can excel at finding optimal or near-optimal solutions for smaller instances.
  This paper aims to integrate CP within a deep learning (DL) based methodology, leveraging
  the benefits of both. In this paper, we introduce a method that involves training
  a DL model using optimal solutions generated by CP, ensuring the model learns from
  high-quality data, thereby eliminating the need for the extensive exploration typical
  in DRL and enhancing overall performance. Further, we integrate CP into our DL framework
  to jointly construct solutions, utilizing DL for the initial complex stages and
  transitioning to CP for optimal resolution as the problem is simplified. Our hybrid
  approach has been extensively tested on three public FJSSP benchmarks, demonstrating
  superior performance over five state-of-the-art DRL approaches and a widely-used
  CP solver. Additionally, with the objective of exploring the application to other
  combinatorial optimization problems, promising preliminary results are presented
  on applying our hybrid approach to the traveling salesman problem, combining an
  exact method with a well-known DRL method.
