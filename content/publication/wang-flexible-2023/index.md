abstract: Flexible manufacturing has given rise to complex scheduling problems such
  as the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In FJSP, operations can be processed
  on multiple machines, leading to intricate relationships between operations and
  machines. Recent works have employed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn
  priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving FJSP. However, the quality of solutions
  still has room for improvement relative to that by the exact methods such as OR-Tools.
  To address this issue, this paper presents a novel end-to-end learning framework
  that weds the merits of self-attention models for deep feature extraction and DRL
  for scalable decision-making. The complex relationships between operations and machines
  are represented precisely and concisely, for which a dual-attention network (DAN)
  comprising several interconnected operation message attention blocks and machine
  message attention blocks is proposed. The DAN exploits the complicated relationships
  to construct production-adaptive operation and machine features to support high-quality
  decisionmaking. Experimental results using synthetic data as well as public benchmarks
  corroborate that the proposed approach outperforms both traditional PDRs and the
  state-of-the-art DRL method. Moreover, it achieves results comparable to exact methods
  in certain cases and demonstrates favorable generalization ability to large-scale
  and real-world unseen FJSP tasks.
