 abstract = {When a retailer has limited inventory and is operating on a periodic selling schedule, it is important to have a variety of products available for each customer. To maximize revenue over the long term, an optimal assortment policy is required that takes into account the complex purchasing behaviors of customers whose arrival order and preferences are unknown. By analyzing historical customer arrival and transaction data, we propose a data-driven approach for dynamic assortment planning. To address the challenge of online assortment customization, we utilize a Markov decision process (MDP) framework and employ a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to learn a policy that is nearly optimal. Our method involves using a specialized deep learning model called Gated-DNN to create assortments while adhering to constraints, and a modified version of the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to adjust the parameters of the Gated-DNN model. The updates to the model’s parameters are done by simulated interactions with historical sequences of customer arrivals. The feedback we receive from simulated customers can take any form and should match the historical transaction data as closely as possible to ensure the effectiveness of the policy we learn. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulations using both a synthetic data set generated with a pre-determined customer type distribution and choice model, as well as a real-world data set. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces significantly higher long-term revenue compared to existing methods and remains robust under various conditions. We also demonstrate that our approach can be easily adapted to a more general problem that includes reusable products, where customers return purchased items after a period of time. In further experiments, we find that our approach performs best under various usage time distributions.},
