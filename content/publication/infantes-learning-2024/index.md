abstract: 'Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem
  where tasks need to be scheduled on machines in order to minimize criteria such
  as makespan or delay. To address more realistic scenarios, we associate a probability
  distribution with the duration of each task. Our objective is to generate a robust
  schedule, i.e. that minimizes the average makespan. This paper introduces a new
  approach that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to search for
  robust solutions, emphasizing JSSPs with uncertain durations. Key contributions
  of this research include: (1) advancements in DRL applications to JSSPs, enhancing
  generalization and scalability, (2) a novel method for addressing JSSPs with uncertain
  durations. The Wheatley approach, which integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  and DRL, is made publicly available for further research and applications.'
