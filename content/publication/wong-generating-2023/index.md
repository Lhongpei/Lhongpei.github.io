abstract: The interrupting swap-allowed blocking job shop problem (ISBJSSP) is a complex
  scheduling problem that is able to model many manufacturing planning and logistics
  applications realistically by addressing both the lack of storage capacity and unforeseen
  production interruptions. Subjected to random disruptions due to machine malfunction
  or maintenance, industry production settings often choose to adopt dispatching rules
  to enable adaptive, real-time re-scheduling, rather than traditional methods that
  require costly re-computation on the new configuration every time the problem condition
  changes dynamically. To generate dispatching rules for the ISBJSSP problem, we introduce
  a dynamic disjunctive graph formulation characterized by nodes and edges subjected
  to continuous deletions and additions. This formulation enables the training of
  an adaptive scheduler utilizing graph neural networks and reinforcement learning.
  Furthermore, a simulator is developed to simulate interruption, swapping, and blocking
  in the ISBJSSP setting. Employing a set of reported benchmark instances, we conduct
  a detailed experimental study on ISBJSSP instances with a range of machine shutdown
  probabilities to show that the scheduling policies generated can outperform or are
  at least as competitive as existing dispatching rules with predetermined priority.
  This study shows that the ISBJSSP, which requires real-time adaptive solutions,
  can be scheduled efficiently with the proposed method when production interruptions
  occur with random machine shutdowns.
