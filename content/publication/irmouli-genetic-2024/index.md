abstract: "This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to address
  the challenges associated with configuring and optimizing genetic algorithms (GAs)
  for solving difficult combinatorial or non-linear problems. The proposed RL+GA method
  was specifically tested on the flow shop scheduling problem (FSP). The hybrid algorithm
  incorporates neural networks (NN) and uses the off-policy method Q-learning or the
  on-policy method Sarsa(0) to control two key genetic algorithm (GA) operators: parent
  selection mechanism and mutation. At each generation, the RL agent's action is determining
  the selection method, the probability of the parent selection and the probability
  of the offspring mutation. This allows the RL agent to dynamically adjust the selection
  and mutation based on its learned policy. The results of the study highlight the
  effectiveness of the RL+GA approach in improving the performance of the primitive
  GA. They also demonstrate its ability to learn and adapt from population diversity
  and solution improvements over time. This adaptability leads to improved scheduling
  solutions compared to static parameter configurations while maintaining population
  diversity throughout the evolutionary process."
