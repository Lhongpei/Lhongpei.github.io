Primal-Dual Hybrid Conjugate Gradient Method (PDHCG) is a GPU-accelerated First Order Method for solving convex quadratic programming problems with state-of-the-art performance.

Please refer to [Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16160) for more details.

Our code can be found in [PDHCG.jl](https://github.com/Huangyc98/PDHCG.jl) and [PDHCG-Python](https://github.com/Lhongpei/PDHCG-Python).
