DRL4IPPS focuses on utilizing Deep Reinforcement Learning to deal with Integrated Processing Planning and Scheduling Problem, which is an extremely hard realistic problem. The proposed method can make decisions within a few seconds and outperform traditional dispatching methods, as well as obtain an improvement of *11.35%* compared with OR-Tools SAT-CP Solver and the Gurobi MILP Solver with a 7200-second time limit on large instances.
