	abstract = {Large-scale competitive market equilibrium problems arise in a wide range of important applications, including economic decision-making and intelligent manufacturing. Traditional solution methods, such as interior-point algorithms and certain projection-based approaches, often fail to scale effectively to large problem instances. In this paper, we propose an efficient computational framework that integrates the primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient (PDHCG) algorithm with GPU-based parallel computing to solve large-scale Fisher market equilibrium problems. By exploiting the underlying mathematical structure of the problem, we establish a theoretical guarantee of linear convergence for the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be extended to solve large-scale Arrow-Debreu market equilibrium problems through a fixed-point iteration scheme. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on GPU platforms demonstrate substantial improvements in computational efficiency, significantly expanding the practical solvable scale and applicability of market equilibrium models.},

	abstract = {The automatic configuration of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) optimizers has become increasingly critical as the large number of configurations can significantly affect solver performance. Yet the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks has led to data leakage and over-optimistic claims, as prior studies often rely on homogeneous datasets and inconsistent experimental setups. To promote a fair evaluation process, we present BenLOC, a comprehensive benchmark and open-source toolkit, which not only offers an end-to-end pipeline for learning instance-wise MIP optimizer configurations, but also standardizes dataset selection, train-test splits, feature engineering and baseline choice for unbiased and comprehensive evaluations. Leveraging this framework, we conduct an empirical analysis on five well-established MIP datasets and compare classical machine learning models with handcrafted features against state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques. The results demonstrate the importance of datasets, features and baseline criteria proposed by BenLOC and the effectiveness of BenLOC in providing unbiased and comprehensive evaluations.},

	abstract = {Convex quadratic programming (QP) is an essential class of optimization problems with broad applications across various fields. Traditional QP solvers, typically based on simplex or barrier methods, face significant scalability challenges. In response to these limitations, recent research has shifted towards matrix-free first-order methods to enhance scalability in QP. Among these, the restarted accelerated primal-dual hybrid gradient (rAPDHG) method, proposed by Lu, has gained notable attention due to its linear convergence rate to an optimal solution and its straightforward implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Building on this framework, this paper introduces a restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient (PDHCG) method, which incorporates conjugate gradient (CG) techniques to address the primal subproblems inexactly. We demonstrate that PDHCG maintains a linear convergence rate with an improved convergence constant and is also straightforward to implement on GPUs. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the number of iterations required to achieve the desired accuracy compared to rAPDHG. Additionally, the GPU implementation of our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale problems. In most large-scale scenarios, our method is approximately 5 times faster than rAPDHG and about 100 times faster than other existing methods. These results highlight the substantial potential of the proposed PDHCG method to greatly improve both the efficiency and scalability of solving complex quadratic programming challenges.},

	abstract = {The Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling (IPPS) problem combines process route planning and shop scheduling to achieve high efficiency in manufacturing and maximize resource utilization, which is crucial for modern manufacturing systems. Traditional methods using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and heuristic algorithms can not well balance solution quality and speed when solving IPPS. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method. We model the IPPS problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture the complex relationships among operations, machines, and jobs. To optimize the scheduling strategy, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Experimental results show that, compared to traditional methods, our approach significantly improves solution efficiency and quality in large-scale IPPS instances, providing superior scheduling strategies for modern intelligent manufacturing systems.},
